# GetX App Learning - Flutter State Management Tutorial

A comprehensive Flutter project designed specifically for students to learn GetX state management patterns and best practices.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as a hands-on learning resource for students who want to master GetX state management in Flutter. It contains practical examples, real-world scenarios, and step-by-step implementations to help you understand GetX concepts thoroughly.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By exploring this project, students will learn:

- **Dependency Injection** with `Get.put()` and `Get.find()`
- **State Management** using `GetBuilder` and reactive programming
- **Navigation** with GetX routing (`Get.to()`, `Get.back()`, etc.)
- **Controller Lifecycle** management
- **Best Practices** for clean, maintainable code architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- An IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArslanYousaf12/getx_app_learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd getx_app_learning
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 📖 Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Dependency Injection
Learn how to register and access controllers throughout your app:
```dart
// Register controller
TabControllerGet tabController = Get.put(TabControllerGet());

// Access controller anywhere
Get.find<TabControllerGet>().increment();
```

### 2. Reactive State Management
Understand how to update UI reactively when state changes:
```dart
GetBuilder<TabControllerGet>(
  builder: (controller) {
    return Text(controller.x.toString());
  },
)
```

### 3. Navigation
Master GetX navigation without context:
```dart
// Navigate to new page
Get.to(NextPage());

// Go back
Get.back();
```
